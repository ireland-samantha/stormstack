 * An {@link EntityComponentStore} with module-level permission checking.

 *
 * <p>Permission enforcement is based on {@link PermissionLevel}:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link PermissionLevel#PRIVATE} - Only the owning module can read or write</li>
 *   <li>{@link PermissionLevel#READ} - Any module can read, only the owner can write</li>
 *   <li>{@link PermissionLevel#WRITE} - Any module can read and write</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>A module always has full access to its own components (as defined by the
 * current module context), regardless of the permission level.
